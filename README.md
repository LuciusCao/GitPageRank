a spider that get all user follow relations from github. The datas got are used for page rank calculation.

#Version1.0
The main web spider has been completed. It can get the all user's following relation from github at an average speed of 10sec/user. I made an estimation that it took the tiny spider 4 years to get all 16,000,000 users down... I'm considering add distributed system to do the job and also trying to write the spider into a class.
